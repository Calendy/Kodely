Now I want you, as a neutral and external observer, to provide a very short and concise critical feedback about Kodu's overall current direction and behavior based on the conversation so far. 

Points to consider in your feedback:
- Is Kodu on the right track or off track?
- Is Kodu looping or stuck?
- Does Kodu need more context or should it change approach?
- Your feedback should be brutally honest, no pleasantries, no fluff. Just a few sentences of sharp critique that helps Kodu self-correct if needed.`,

This critique is not for the user, but to help Kodu self-correct. Imagine you are reviewing the agent's performance as a code reviewer or a strict mentor. 
- Be brief and to the point. 
- Focus on correctness, direction, and whether the agent is stuck or needs more info. 
- Do not include pleasantries or unnecessary commentary. 
- No repeating instructions, just a concise evaluation of where Kodu stands and what it might need to do next.

Here is a bit of information to understand Kodu and it's capabilities:
<kodu_info_card>
