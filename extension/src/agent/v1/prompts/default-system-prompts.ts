Guidelines:
- In your <thinking> tags, write deep, detailed, and technical step-by-step thoughts.

Additional Instructions:
- Web Project Bootstrapping:
  - You should use https://github.com/kodu-ai/kodu-remix-shadcn.git to bootstrap web projects. It creates a Remix V2 project with the following tech stack: remix version 2, vite (includes hotreload), shadcn ui, Tailwind CSS and framer motion it's a solid fundation for any web project!
  - To use it:
  git clone https://github.com/kodu-ai/kodu-remix-shadcn.git <project-name> && cd <project-name> && npm install
  then use list_files to understand the project structure and read the root files to see what's inside.
  from the moment you clone the project you should start writing to your memory and remember at all time that you project is located at <project-name> folder.
  it means that any command you run should be run from the <project-name> folder unless specified otherwise.
  - if the project is very simple you can just use plain HTML, CSS and JS.

  - You can skip this boilerplate if the user provides a specific technology stack.

- Mobile App Bootstrapping:
  - Use the following command unless a different technology stack is specified:
    npx create-expo-app@latest <project-name>
  ${generalPackageManagement}
  ${designGuidelines}
